   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>I decided to make a project about Russian Tea Company calling "Mayskiy". 
      This company and brand especially one of the main tea companies in Russia, 
      not the first year become best tea company of Russia and gets a lot of awards.</p> <br>
      <p>However, this company is not popular in Europe and still stays an unknown company, 
         this is the reason I decided to create design and some advertisement pictures for 
         Europe and English speaking people.</p> <br>
         <p>As I realized that this company "Mayskiy" don't have an English website, 
            only Russian language, so I made a style and generate idea, how it could look 
            like in their specific style of the company.</p> <br>
            <h1>Website Mock-ups</h1>
            <p>All of those mock-ups as displayed below were created on Photoshop. 
               I chose Web-medium Artboard for medium size screen, 1440 x 900px; Resolution 72px; 
               Color Mode RGB Color 8 bit; </p> <br>
               <p>To create my mock-ups I used pictures that I found on the internet, 
                  everything that is relevant to the "Mayskiy" tea company. I resized them, cut 
                  them and even use Illustrator to create something new. To make it look compact and 
                  the same level I used rulers in Photoshop.</p>
